# OS_projects
this is a project in the operating systems course in Ain Shams university
 
In this project,My team and I will write a program that implements the FIFO, LRU, LFU, SecondChance, 
Enhance Second-Chance, and optimal page replacement algorithms. First,
generate a random page-reference string where page numbers range from 0 to 99. Apply
the random page-reference string to each algorithm and record the number of page faults
incurred by each algorithm. Implement the replacement algorithms so that the number of
page frames can vary from 1 to 20.
